<h1> Hi there! </h1>

Welcome to my webpage.
This webpage was created for a web development assignment. 

Edx, an online based education system, has a course called CS50B. This course teaches you the basics of computer programming.
In this course, we learn about web development. Because of this, our assignment consists of creating a webpage in GitHub.

I called my repository "richcoast" because I was born in Costa Rica which translates to rich coast in english. 

Costa Rica is a little country in central america. It often gets confused with Puerto Rico or people think its an island.
